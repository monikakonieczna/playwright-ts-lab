## üìñ Playwright Locator Syntax Guide

| **Locator Type**                  | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Example**                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **By Tag Name**                   | Selects elements by their tag name.                                                                                  | `page.locator('input');`                                                                                              |
| **By ID**                         | Selects elements by their unique ID attribute.                                                                       | `page.locator('#inputEmail1');`                                                                                       |
| **By Class Value**                | Selects elements by a specific class name.                                                                           | `page.locator('.status-basic');`                                                                                      |
| **By Attribute**                  | Selects elements based on a specific attribute value.                                                                | `page.locator('[placeholder="Email"]');`                                                                              |
| **By Exact Class Value**          | Exact match of the full class attribute value (not recommended due to Instability).                                  | `page.locator('[class="input-full-width size-medium status-basic shape-rectangle nb-transition"]');`                  |
| **Combining Selectors**           | Combines multiple attributes for a more specific locator.                                                            | `page.locator('[type="email"][fullwidth]');`                                                                          |
| **By XPath**                      | Selects elements using XPath syntax (use sparingly as it‚Äôs less readable).                                           | `page.locator('//*[@id="inputEmail1"]');`                                                                             |
| **By Partial Text Match**         | Selects elements based on a partial text match, useful for dynamic content.                                          | `page.getByText('Using');`                                                                                            |
| **By Full Text Match**            | Selects elements by matching the exact text content.                                                                 | `page.getByText('Using the Grid', { exact: true });`                                                                  |
| **By Role and Name**              | Uses ARIA role and accessible name for alignment with accessibility practices.                                       | `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' });`                                                                      |
| **By Contextual Selection**       | Finds a div containing a button with specific text.                                                                  | `page.locator('div', { has: page.getByText('Click me') });`                                                           |
| **Select Element by Index**       | Chooses an element based on its index in the list of matches (0-based index).                                        | `page.locator('input').nth(1);`                                                                                       |
| **Avoiding Hard Waits**           | Waits for specific element states instead of using `waitForTimeout()` for better test reliability.                   | `page.locator('#inputEmail1').waitFor({ state: 'visible' });`                                                         |                                                                              |
| **Chaining Locators for Context** | Narrows down the search within a specific context by chaining locators.                                              | `page.locator('.form').locator('input[type="email"]').fill('test@example.com');`                                      |
| **Select First or Last Element**  | Simplifies selection of the first or last matching element in a list.                                                | `page.locator('li').first().click();`<br>`page.locator('li').last().click();`                                        |
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

## üèÉ Test Execution with CLI
To execute tests with Playwright via the CLI, you can use the Playwright Test Runner, which is a powerful tool for running your tests, controlling the execution environment, and generating reports.
1. Run all tests
To run all the tests in your project, simply use the following command:
```
npx playwright test
```
2. Run Specific Test Files
```
npx playwright test tests/sample.spec.ts
```
You can also run multiple test files:
```
npx playwright test tests/test1.spec.ts tests/test2.spec.ts
```
3. Run Tests in Specific Browser
Playwright supports cross-browser testing with chromium, firefox, and webkit. To run the tests in a specific browser, use the --project option.
To run tests in Chromium:
```
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
To run tests in Firefox:
```
npx playwright test --project=firefox
```
To run tests in WebKit:
```
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```
4. Run Tests with Headed Mode
By default, Playwright runs tests in headless mode (without UI). To run the tests with a visible browser window, use the --headed flag:
```
npx playwright test --headed
```

## üèÉTest Execution with UI
1. Run Tests from UI
```
npx playwright test --ui
```

## üìä Reports
1. Run Tests with Reporters
Playwright provides several reporting options. You can generate HTML, JSON, or other formats.
- HTML Report: To generate an HTML report after running tests:
```
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```
- JSON Report: To generate a JSON report:
```
npx playwright test --reporter=json
```
2. After running the tests, you can view the generated reports.
HTML Report: If you've run tests with the --reporter=html flag, you can open the report by navigating to the playwright-report folder:
```
npx playwright show-report
```

## ü§ñ Continuous Integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips
1. Run Tests with Debugging
For debugging, you can run tests with additional debug information. Use the --debug flag:
```
npx playwright test --debug
```
2. Recording a trace locally
To record a trace during development mode set the --trace flag to on when running your tests.
```
npx playwright test --trace=on
```
3. Recording a trace on CI
Traces can be enabled during continuous integration on the first retry of a failed test by configuring the trace: 'on-first-retry' option in the test configuration file.
```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  retries: 1,
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
});
```
Available options to record a trace:
- 'on-first-retry' - Record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
- 'on-all-retries' - Record traces for all test retries.
- 'off' - Do not record a trace.
- 'on' - Record a trace for each test. (not recommended as it's performance heavy)
- 'retain-on-failure' - Record a trace for each test, but remove it from successful test runs.
4. Debugging with highlight()
Highlight the element during test execution for easier debugging.
```
page.locator('input').highlight();
```
